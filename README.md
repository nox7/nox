# Nox
Nox is a minimal-dependency bearing PHP v8 web framework with minimally invasive syntax. There's no new syntax to learn for arguments and there isn't a huge depth of dependencies. The code is transparent and leaves a small footprint - to make debugging significantly easier.

## Installing
Use composer

```bash
composer require nox7/nox
```
